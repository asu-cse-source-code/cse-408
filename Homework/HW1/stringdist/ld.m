% compute Levenshtein distance (LD) between sentences and then 
% decide if the 2nd sentence:
% - can be ignored (INPUT1 and 2),
% - should replace the first sentence (INPUT 3), or
% - stored along with the first sentence (INPUT4).
%# As the difference is computed, a decision is made on the new event
%# (string 2) to be ignored, to replace existing event (string 1) or to be
%# stored separately. The higher the LD metric, the higher the difference
%# between two strings. Of course, lower difference indices either identical
%# or similar events. However, the higher difference indicates the new event
%# as a fresh event.
