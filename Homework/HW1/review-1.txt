The only grace note in the generally clunky Wonder Woman is its star, the five-foot-ten-inch Israeli actress and model Gal Gadot, who is somehow the perfect blend of superbabe-in-the-woods innocence and mouthiness. She plays Diana, the daughter of the Amazon queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and a trained warrior. But she's also a militant peacenik. Diana lives with Amazon women on a mystically shrouded island but she's not Amazonian herself. She was, we're told, sculpted by her mother from clay and brought to life by Zeus. (I'd like to have seen that.)
